## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit & Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add MySQL themes with secure credentials"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

**Option A: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. **ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** (see below)
5. Click "Deploy"

**Option B: Vercel CLI**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```

### 3. Add Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to: **Project Settings** → **Environment Variables**

Add these (copy-paste ready):

```
MYSQL_HOST=srv1837.hstgr.io
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=u190097430_appcraftuary
MYSQL_PASSWORD=$Udarshan$123.
MYSQL_DATABASE=u190097430_fapp
PUBLIC_WEBSITE_URL=https://your-project.vercel.app
```

**Important:** Set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### 4. Enable Remote MySQL in Hostinger

1. Log into Hostinger Control Panel
2. Go to **Databases** → **Remote MySQL**
3. Add `%` to allow all IPs (or add Vercel's specific IPs)
4. Save

### 5. Redeploy

After adding environment variables:
- Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
- Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment

---

## 🧪 Test Your Site

Visit these URLs after deployment:

- Homepage: `https://your-project.vercel.app/`
- Themes page: `https://your-project.vercel.app/themes`
- Themes API: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/themes`

**Expected:** Themes page shows your real data from Hostinger MySQL

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see mock data instead of real themes:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs:**
   - Dashboard → Your Project → Logs
   - Look for database errors

2. **Verify Hostinger Remote MySQL:**
   - Control Panel → Databases → Remote MySQL
   - Make sure `%` is added or Vercel IPs are whitelisted

3. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Verify all MySQL variables are set correctly

4. **Redeploy:**
   - After fixing, redeploy from Deployments tab

### Common Issues:

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Mock data showing | DB connection failed | Enable remote MySQL in Hostinger |
| "Access denied" | Wrong password | Double-check `MYSQL_PASSWORD` in Vercel |
| Connection timeout | Hostinger blocking | Whitelist IPs in Remote MySQL |
| Build error on Windows | Symlink permissions | Ignore - builds fine on Vercel |
